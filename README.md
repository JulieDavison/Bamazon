## Description
This application is an Amazon-like storefront using MySQL and Node.js which will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.  The npm packages required are inquirer.
For now the application takes in customer data for example which item to purchase and the quantity.
In the future I will add the views for the manager and a supervisor.
